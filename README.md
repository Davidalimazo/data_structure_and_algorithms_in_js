## Lessons Learned

This project help deepen my understanding of data structures to build better and more effecient softwares. I encountered some challenges such as reasoning the optimal way to implement this algorithms to obtained the best Big O notation, time to complete this project was also a challenge, By practising trial and error i was able to get the best optimal solution for each algorithm, while practising effective time management, helped me to surmount time constraint.
